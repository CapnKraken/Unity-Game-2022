Input management
Camera Control system

Bullet pattern system
	
	Have global class which stores the compiled pattern files. When an enemy is spawned, it can grab the one it needs from that

	IMPLEMENTATION:
		Commands: always "action value action value" since they're all numbers. The actions will be ints
		repeats: Stack of objects storing the repeat count and the line it began at
		when the program reaches a repeat, push a repeat object to the stack
		when it reaches the end repeat, pop, decrement
			if > 0, push back and return to the start line
			if it's 0, leave it off

	Input file- 1 command per line
	Output (read by program)
		Array of actions stored as strings
		for instance:
			"0 4.6" is equal to "Wait 4.6" in the file
		
	Reading
		Timer variable, ticks down per frame if greater than 0
		If timer == 0, do action at current index, otherwise, hold on
			split string
		If index == length, set index to 0

	SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
		I want to be able to not have to type in every number every time I call the shoot command
			//Something like
			Shoot Burst 4 Speed 10
			Wait 0.2
			Shoot Speed 15

			//This would shoot a 4-burst with speed of 10, wait .2 seconds, then shoot a 4-burst with speed of 15
