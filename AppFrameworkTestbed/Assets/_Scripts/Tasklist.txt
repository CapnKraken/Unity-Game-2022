Camera Control system

Object pool
	-Queue or stack, doesn't matter I suppose. Probably use Queue because it's more intuitive
	-when object is in the queue, move it far away to avoid memory hit of deactivation


Bullet Spawner Object
	-shoots bullet when it receives a shoot event
Bullet
	-direction, speed
	-moves in the direction, at the speed, until it's out of the bounding box, then deletes

	Need:
		sprite
			int- refers to a global list of bullet sprites
		radius
			sets the radius of the bullet. This will also be a global list and tied to the type
		--both of these will be worked on in the pattern files by a type parameter of spawn
