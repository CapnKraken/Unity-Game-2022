Input management
Camera Control system

Object pool
	-Queue or stack, doesn't matter I suppose. Probably use Queue because it's more intuitive
	-when object is in the queue, move it far away to avoid memory hit of deactivation


Bullet Spawner Object
	-shoots bullet when it receives a shoot event
Bullet
	-direction, speed
	-moves in the direction, at the speed, until it's out of the bounding box, then deletes

Bullet pattern system
	
	Have global class which stores the compiled pattern files. When an enemy is spawned, it can grab the one it needs from that

	IMPLEMENTATION:
		
	Next to do: 
		random number
			Random {variable name} {min inclusive} {max inclusive}

		direction from position to player

			AngleToPlayer {variable name} {location} {x} {y}
