Input management
Camera Control system

Object pool
	-Queue or stack, doesn't matter I suppose. Probably use Queue because it's more intuitive
	-when object is in the queue, move it far away to avoid memory hit of deactivation


Bullet Spawner Object
	-shoots bullet when it receives a shoot event
Bullet
	-direction, speed
	-moves in the direction, at the speed, until it's out of the bounding box, then deletes

WILL NEED
	how to guide detailing how to use all of the functionality I've built
		pattern programming guide
		how to use gamemanager, managed object, hitcircle
